### Implementation of a neural network framework


## Status:  Periodically supplemented.

## Willingness: Working alpha version.

This framework is written from scratch and completely self-sufficient. The goal of this framework is to provide networking opportunities for simple regression and classification.
The main functionality includes:
- Download dataset for training.
- Create a neural network or download it from a file.
- Training.
- Saving the network to a file.
- Prediction by input.

Plans:
- Add data providers to integrate into applications.
- Optimization of the learning algorithm.
- Addition of the k-nearest neighbor's algorithm.
- Archiving the model.
